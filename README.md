# Ralph Loop

Autonomous AI coding via a bash loop with fresh context each iteration. Based on [The Ralph Playbook](https://ghuntley.com/ralph/).

## How It Works

```
Phase 1: Define Requirements     (you + LLM write specs)
Phase 2: Planning Mode           (Ralph generates IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md)
Phase 3: Building Mode           (Ralph implements from plan, one task per loop)
```

Each loop iteration gets fresh context. No confusion buildup. The plan file on disk is the shared state between iterations.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Initialize in your project
scripts/init_ralph.sh /path/to/project
cd /path/to/project

# 1. Edit PROMPT_plan.md — replace [project-specific goal]
# 2. Edit AGENTS.md — add your build/test/lint commands
# 3. Write specs in specs/ (one per topic of concern)

# Generate the plan
./loop.sh plan

# Build from the plan
./loop.sh
```

## File Structure

```
project-root/
├── loop.sh              # The loop (plan/build modes)
├── PROMPT_plan.md       # Planning prompt
├── PROMPT_build.md      # Building prompt
├── AGENTS.md            # Operational guide (build/test commands)
├── IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md  # Generated by Ralph
├── specs/               # One spec per topic of concern
└── src/                 # Your code
```

## Loop Modes

| Command | Mode | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `./loop.sh plan` | Planning | Gap analysis, generates plan |
| `./loop.sh plan 5` | Planning | Max 5 iterations |
| `./loop.sh` | Building | Implements from plan |
| `./loop.sh 20` | Building | Max 20 iterations |

## Key Ideas

- **Two prompts, one loop**: Swap between planning and building by passing `plan` argument
- **AGENTS.md**: Operational guide with build/test commands. Loaded every iteration. Keep it brief.
- **Plan is disposable**: Wrong plan? Delete it, run `./loop.sh plan` again
- **Subagents as memory**: Fan out reads/searches to subagents, keep main context clean
- **Backpressure**: Tests/builds reject bad work. AGENTS.md wires in project-specific commands.
